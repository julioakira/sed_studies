# Studies about sed
Some studies about how Unix's sed tool works and some patterns that can be used. They cover some of the primary **sed** use cases, bearing in mind that would be impossible to cover all the possible cases.

## What can i do with this?
You can use it to study yourself, and distribute the markdowns as you want. It is advised to **TEST** the commands beforehand, as it might have some mistakes.

## Where to begin?
The best order for better comprehension is the following:

- [How Sed Works](sed-study-pt-00.md)
- [Sed Study Pt. 1](sed-study-pt-01.md)
- [Sed Study Pt. 2](sed-study-pt-02.md)

## References

These studies are based upon the [GNU sed manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) and YouTube tutorials made by the users [Kris Occhipinti](https://www.youtube.com/c/KrisOcchipinti) and [nixcasts](https://www.youtube.com/user/connermcd).
